# Use PROOF to speed up processing of a chain
# Will break some scripts currently, this will be fixed
UsePROOF yes

# --- Settings for analysing states ---

# Use a PID gate (TOF vs Pad1 Energy)
# This is nearly always needed to clean up the 0 degree halo
# If PIDfile is TREE it will use the embedded PID in the tree for gating
UsePID yes
PIDfile TREE

# Use an additional PID gate: X1vsTOF
# This doesn't really cut much extra out, but who knows?
UseX1tofPID no
X1tofPIDfile CUTX1tof1098

# Gate on silicon particle energy, to filter out low/high energy noise
# Units are keV
