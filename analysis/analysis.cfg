# Use PROOF to speed up processing of a chain
# Will break some scripts currently, this will be fixed
UsePROOF yes
# Number of PROOF workers (i.e. threads) to use, 0 to use the same number
# as the number of CPU cores/threads.
# For smaller data sets, the merging can take longer than the processing,
# and reducing the workers can speed this up

# --- Settings for analysing states ---

# Use a PID gate (TOF vs Pad1 Energy)
# This is nearly always needed to clean up the 0 degree halo
# If PIDfile is TREE it will use the embedded PID in the tree for gating
UsePID yes
PIDfile CUTpid1107

# Use an additional PID gate: X1vsTOF
# This doesn't really cut much extra out, but who knows?
UseX1tofPID no
